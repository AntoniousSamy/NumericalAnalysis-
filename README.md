## Introduction

In this project, we explore various numerical analysis methods that are commonly used in solving mathematical problems and optimizing algorithms. The implementation is done using WPF, a graphical user interface framework for Windows applications, and the code is written in C#.

The project includes the following numerical analysis methods:

- Bisection Method
- False Position Method
- Simple Fixed Point Iteration Method
- Newton's Method
- Golden Section Search
- Secant Method
- Gauss Elimination Method
- Cramer's Rule
- LU Decomposition
- Gradient Method

These methods cover a range of topics in numerical analysis, including root-finding, interpolation, approximation, numerical integration, linear and nonlinear systems of equations, and optimization.

This project provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the implemented algorithms and visualize the results.

## Features

- Collection of numerical analysis algorithms and techniques
- Implementation using WPF and C# for a Windows-based application
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction and visualization
- Well-documented code for easy understanding and usage
- Detailed explanations of each algorithm and its applications
- Examples and test cases to showcase the usage and effectiveness of the implemented methods

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/numerical-analysis-project.git`.
